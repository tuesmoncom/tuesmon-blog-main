Summary: ![Tuesmon Day]({filename}/images/2014-11-18_changelog130/image01.jpg) Dryas Hookeriana is a member of the Rose family (a Rose by any other name….) Like Tuesmon's Madrid-based development team, it prefers a sunny to half-shady situation. Come to think of it who, other than some select politicians would prefer a half-shady situation?

Well, enough of that…. The Dryas release is action packed. First off:

**New features**

- **Github** Tuesmontize your GitHub Repos! - We now integrate with GitHub!

If your code lives on GitHub, you´ll love how Tuesmon's simple, intuitive Project Management sits over your projects. Please be patient, we are integrating Tuesmon into GitHub in several stages.  With Phase 1 now complete. You can:

- One-click log into Tuesmon.com with your GitHub credentials.
- Change the status of User Stories, Tasks and Issues on Tuesmon with a GitHub commit message
- Sync Issues and comments generated on GitHub with Tuesmon (one-way for now)

Be sure to **clear your cache and log out before logging back into Tuesmon.com to access all the Gitness.** To integrate your repositories, **be sure you have admin privileges** on the given Tuesmon Project, then go to Admin / Third Parties and follow the instructions.

**UI Improvements**

- In Kanban, you can now collapse a column to rail thin-ness, improving horizontal scrolling.

**Misc**

- Quite a few bug fixes, big and small.

_p.s. Speaking of big and small, this week we tip our hat and bow deeply at Dr. Matt Taylor and his team who did nothing more than, oh say.... **land a probe on a comet after a 10-year interplanetary cat and mouse chase.** Makes little 'ol Tuesmon Dryas Hookeriana Release (v1.3.0) seem a trifle petite... Let's see what we can cook up in v1.4 to make up for it....!_
