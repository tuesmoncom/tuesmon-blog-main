So, let's see... what do we have for you this time?

**New features**

- If you like your code repositories opensource, and you use GitLab, you're in luck. **Tuesmon now integrates with GitLab!**
- If you prefer BitBucket, you're also in luck. **BitBucket integration is also online now.**
- Check our the new **Team View** feature to see which team members are working on a project
- Unhappy with a project? Use the "I'm outta here" here **exit a project feature**

**UI Improvements**

- We did some **Taskboard redesign** to take better advantage of the screen real estate and help you see more of your project. Rows and columns can now be shrunk as well.
- We improved usability in tablets. But note we still don't support tablets
- We made some other general usability enhancements

**Misc**

- **We killed tons of little bugs**, including layout errors with certain browsers.
- **Improvements to concurrent editing**. Now when more than one person is editing the same field at the same time, the system not only alerts the users to avoid overwriting the work of a colleague, it doesn't complain if small differences within blocks are different and accepts all changes. Oh... the little courtesies that make life bearable...
- We migrated to the **new version of angular (1.3)**

We took some time off as well. In fact there was long weekend last week and we did absolutely nothing, zilch, nada. But we'll make it up, we promise.
