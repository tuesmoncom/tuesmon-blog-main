Welcome to Tuesmon's latest release, Betula Nana (v.3.2.0) named after the dwarf birch, a species of birch found mainly in the tundra of the Arctic region.

This release brings general stability improvements and some nice new features. It's an interim release that has us putting out some nice features while we ready other more major upgrades. So "dwarf" is quite apropos...

So, without further ado, here's what we have for you this time:

###EMOJIS ARE NOW SUPPORTED ON SUBJECTS AND TAGS
Emojis are now supported on subjects and tags. Write a thousand words with a single image in user stories, tasks and elsewhere.

###ADD 'CONFIRM DIALOG' BEFORE CLOSING EDIT LIGHTBOXES
We help you avoid lost work by adding a “confirm dialog” before closing edit lightboxes. We now added a confirmation prior to a dialogue box shutting down if changes in the lightbox were made

###ADDED THE ABILITY TO DO MULTIPLE DRAG AND DROP IN KANBAN
Added the ability to do multiple drag and drop in Kanban. You can now select multiple cards and drag and drop together to other columns. A real time saver!

###OTHER NEW FEATURES THAT IMPROVE WORKFLOW

- **WIKI ACTIVITY IS HIDDEN BY DEFAULT** Focus on your wiki edition.
- **ALLOW ASCENDING VOTES ORDERING IN THE ISSUES LIST** Prior to this, you could only order in descending fashion so you can sort by lowest voted.
- **SHOW US COUNTER AND WIP LIMIT IN KANBAN COLUMNS TITLE** Introduced a new User Story counter and WIP limit in Kanban columns title. The column headers now show the number of cards in each column
- **SQUASH FIELD CHANGES ON NOTIFICATION EMAILS** This is a minor improvement to reduce how "verbose" the notification system. So for instance, if the title in a User Story is changed, the notification message sent by the system shows only the definitive change, and no longer the intermediate changes.
