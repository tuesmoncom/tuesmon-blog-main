Sheer envy led us to the name of this release; how much more could we be doing with eight arms instead of 2? Perhaps not much. We've been flat out, working on very significant updates to Tuesmon, the release of the upcoming and very cool Tuesmon Tribe and getting ready for the Tuesmon paid plans which we need to ensure we keep our lights on! *Here are some the highlights from this release:*

###Discover public projects
The platform we always imagined (and decided to build) not only needed to be beautiful and intuitive, it needed to be "place" where we could congregate to learn and help each other. Today we are proud to announce our new searchable directory of Public Projects. Explore backlogs, timelines, issues, and teams. Check out the most liked or most active projects. Filter by Kanban or Scrum.

Curious to see what it's all about? Once you're logged in, click on the new "globe" icon on top navigation bar. [Or click here!](https://manage.tuesmon.com/discover)

**Important if you are a project owner**
If you enabled “view” rights for “External Users”, some of your project modules may be publicly visible to Tuesmon members and other anonymous users. If you did intend your projects to remain completely private, be sure all the “view” permissions for the member “External Users” have been disabled in your admin panel (admin rights required).

###Improved project profile
Now that people can see your project (if its public) dress it up. Add a nice logo image, a short, memorable description use tags that define your work. Do this even if your project is private, you still want to look good for the ones in the know.

###Drag and drop attachments from your desktop to Tuesmon
A better and improved attachments UI requires a better attachments management. Just drag and drop your attachments from the desktop into the attachments module or in the detail description to upload images. Fast!

###Improved Attachment Handling
Save time by dragging attachments from your desktop to the attachments section or into WYSIWYG areas. There is now an attachments image gallery in detail pages. Also mush easier light box-enabled attachment uploading to User Stories, Issues and Tasks.

###Assign to me button
Sometimes, if you want something done well, you just have to do it yourself. If that's the case with you, now when a Story, task or issue are unassigned, you can quickly assign it to yourself.
