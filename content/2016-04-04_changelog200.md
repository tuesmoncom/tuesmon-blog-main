Whew! This is our 11th release in 18 months! The only people busier than we are are you -- **the 120,000 registered Tuesmon users who've initiated over 450,000 user stories**! Wow!

So 2.0 is chock full of stuff. With no further ado:

###Paid Plans
If there's anything we love more than an 18-month free ride, it's being able to pay our bills. As an Open Source tool, we will continue to offer our tool for free either as a self-install, or on our cloud for those of you who don't mind [sharing your projects publicly on Tuesmon](https://manage.tuesmon.com/discover)

But alas, some services, namely the ability to keep projects private will incur a (modest, we think) fee. But even then, you will still get one private project as part of our free plan!

But if you want privacy for 2 or more projects, the time has come to register for a payment plan. If this applies to you, starting now and until April 30, 2016 you can (must) pre-register for one of paid plans by going to you user settings.

Pre-Register for a paid plan now. You will not be charged until April 30th for your first month of service in May. If you dot not pre-registered prior to April 30, your account will be inaccessible starting May 1st. You will be able to unblock it by making projects private or subscribing to a plan. Your data WILL NOT be erased. Feel free to contact us at [support@tuesmon.com](mailto:support@tuesmon.com)  if you have any special needs, issuances of Purchase Orders, etc.

###Transfer Ownership
People come and go. Now, if needed, a project owner can transfer ownership to another member. Any user with admin privileges can request the current owner to transfer ownership to them.

###Ownership Badge
Who owns ya baby? To make sure all the members of a project know who has ownership privileges,  we've added a "badge" that identifies the project owner. Be aware that the project owner is the only one with the permissions to subscribe to a paid plan.

###Create URL custom fields
Sometimes is great to use a nice reference to an external link to complete the description of your User Story, Task or issue. Thanks to Δndrea Stagi ([@astagi](https://github.com/astagi){target="_blank"}) we have a new URL field type. Easy to add in your custom fields!

###On self Hosted instances: Limit number of users and projects (both private & public)
If you run your own Tuesmon instance, you can now limit the number of members any given project can have or the number of private or public projects a user can own.

###New icon design
We've squeezed better performance and have created a more unified an aesthetic experience by redesigning our icons. Get them at the [Tuesmon Open Design Repository](https://github.com/tuesmoncom/tuesmon-design/tree/master/icons){target="_blank"}

Is that all? Of course not! We nailed many small and not so small bugs and made a good number of small fixes.
