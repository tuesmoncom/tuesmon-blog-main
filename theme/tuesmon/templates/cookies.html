                Our lawyer, who is one tough cookie, and is himself obsessed with cookies, wants you to know

                <a target="_blank" href="{{ PRIVACY_POLICY_URL }}">clicking here</a>, is best
                summarized by the Cookie Monster himself: "C is for Cookie and Cookie is for me."
